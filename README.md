# Portfolio Site
This is my personal portfolio site created with Next.js. I originally thought react was overkill for my portfolio, and started with a version using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and Webpack. However, with the media size and Three.js canvas processing, going to Next.js sent my site performance scores and general usability through the roof.

## Tech Used
- Next.js
- React Three Fiber
- Framer Motion
- Formspree
